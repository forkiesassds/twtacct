## Rules
1. Content must be SFW and legal, we don't want your porn.
2. No obfuscated JavaScript, ads or any malicious content.
3. Your code must run on a potato, no bloated JavaScript librairies. Optimally it should be clean W3C spec.
----
## Other guidelines
- You should try to keep your code as simple as possible. More often than not JavaScript is unnecessary and you can usually get away with acheiving something through basic HTML and CSS.
- Librairies are generally not needed and add extra bloat. Things like Bootstrap and JQuery aren't needed for our purposes.
- You don't need to worry too much about compatibility. Believe it or not, HTML5, CSS3 and ECMAScript 2015 were all standardized in 2015 and should be safe to use. Nobody uses Internet Explorer (which actually does support HTML5) and if they do, too bad! Then again, you also shouldn't be using brand new experimental features such as ECMAScript 2019, WebGL 2, or CSS4.
- The primairy purpose of issue submissions is to bring up requests and discussions over whats on a page. Keep this in mind when subbmitting one.

Note: Your commit *could* be reverted at any time if someone else requests to do so. Other than the rules above, this is complete anarchy (although we advise you respect the work and property of others).
